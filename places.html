        <h1>Monuments</h1>
        <p>Among the numerous monuments of particular interest in the city are those from the Roman period, the Triumphal Arch of Galerius (Kamara) and the Rotonda. 
            Thessaloniki is, however, above all famous for its Byzantine period, being second only to Constantinople itself. Its many churches whose fine mosaics and 
            wall-paintings are representative of various periods of Byzantine art have survive to enhance the image of the city. One of the most beautiful church is 
            that of Agia Sofia (Ag. Sofia). Large sections of the city-walls (kastra) are also still standing, together with one of their main bastions, the well-known 
            White Tower (lefkos Pyrgos).</p>
        <h1>Other places to visit</h1>
        <p>For a combination of shopping and sightseeing we recomment you visit Navarinou str (Navarino) and Vardaris Square (Vardaris). In addition you may enjoy a walk 
            on the famous Aristotelous str (Aristotelous).</p>
        <p>
            For a more cultural outing try to book a seat at the Macedonian Study Theater (theater), or if it is Early September 
            that you visit the city, visit the Helexpo (ekthesi).</p>
