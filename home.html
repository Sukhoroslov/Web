It stretches over twelve kilometers in a bowl formed by low hills facing a bay that opens into the Gulf Thermaikos.</p>
        <p>The town has today two quite distinct sectors: The "old town", continuously undergoing reconstruction, and the modern sector, whose many modern buildings are examples of advanced architecture.</p>
